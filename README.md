Mini Calendar

A simple mini calendar widget that displays only the current date, day of the week, month, and year. The layout shows the date and weekday on one side of the card and the month with the full year on the other side.

Features

Displays today’s date

Shows the current weekday

Shows the current month (written with full month names)

Displays the current year

Automatically formats single–digit dates with a leading zero (e.g., 08 instead of 8)

How It Works

Retrieves the current date using the built-in Date() object

Maps numbers to month names and weekday names

Inserts the correct values into the HTML elements

Adds a leading zero to dates from 1 to 9 for a cleaner design

Updates date, day, month, and year dynamically every time the page loads
